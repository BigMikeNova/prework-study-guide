# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to introduce myself to the basic building blocks of web development. Using introductory HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git knowledge, a study guide for stressed out bootcamp students was created to reinforce the basics of web dev. While creating this project took only a few hours it will help me and hopefully others to understand what each language is used for and why it should be used.
